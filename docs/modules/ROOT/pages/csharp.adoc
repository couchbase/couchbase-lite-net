== Getting Started

=== UWP project

Create or open an existing Virtual Studio project and install Couchbase Lite using the following method.

=== Nuget

* Add `http://mobile.nuget.couchbase.com/nuget/Developer/` to your Nuget package sources (for prerelease only).

Your app must call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the
class that is included in the support assembly (there is only one public class in each support assembly, and the support assembly itself is a nuget dependency).
+
For example, UWP looks like `Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP.Activate()`. Currently the support assemblies provide dependency injected mechanisms for default directory logic, and platform specific logging (i.e. Android will log to logcat with correct log levels and tags. No more "mono-stdout" at always info
level).

=== Starter code

Open *Main.cs* in Visual Studio and copy the following code in the `main` method. This snippet demonstrates
how to run basic CRUD operations, a simple Query and running
bi-directional replications with Sync Gateway.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=getting-started]
----

Build and run. You should see the document ID and property printed to
the console. The document was successfully persisted to the database.

== Supported Versions

Couchbase Lite .NET is a .NET Standard 2.0 library. Runtimes which have received more
testing and are *officially* supported are:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=========================================================
|.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version
|.NET Core Win |2.0 |10 (any Microsoft supported)
|.NET Framework |4.6.1 |10 (any Microsoft supported)
|UWP |6.0.1 |10.0.16299
|=========================================================

The following runtimes are also compatible but have not received as much
testing and are *not officially* supported yet, but they will be once
they go through the QE process.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=========================================================
|.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version
|.NET Core Mac |2.0 |10.12
|.NET Core Linux |2.0 |n/a*
|Xamarin iOS |10.14 |10.3.1
|Xamarin Android |8.0 |4.4 (API 19)
|=========================================================

* There are many different variants of Linux, and we don't have the
resources to test all of them. They are tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but have
been shown to work on CentOS, and in theory work on any distro supported
by .NET Core.

Comparing this to 1.x you can see we've traded some lower obsolete
versions for new platform support:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=========================================================
|.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version
|.NET Framework |3.5 |XP
|Mono Mac |5.2* |10.9
|Mono Linux |5.2* |n/a**
|Xamarin iOS |8.0* |8.0
|Xamarin Android |4.6* |2.3 (API 9)
|=========================================================

* These runtime versions are approximate. Couchbase Lite 1.x is built
using relatively new versions of all of these and an absolute minimum is
unclear, and cannot actually be determined anymore due to lack of vendor
support (i.e. Xamarin iOS 8 uses Xcode 6, etc). So basically "any
version" is an approximately good metric here.

** See above note about Linux

== Upgrading

=== Visual Studio

The public facing API has completely changed in Couchbase Lite 2.0 and will require a re-write to upgrade an application that is using Couchbase Lite 1.x. To update an Xcode project built with Couchbase Lite 1.x:

* Remove the existing Couchbase Lite nuget package from the Visual Studio project.
* Remove all the Couchbase Lite 1.x dependencies (see the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/installation/ios/index.html#ios-amp-tvos[1.x installation guide]).
* Install the Couchbase Lite 2.0 framework in your project (see the link:csharp.html#getting-started[installation options]). At this point, there will be many compiler warnings. Refer to the examples on this page to learn about the new API.
* Build & run your application.

=== Database Upgrade

Databases that were created with Couchbase Lite 1.2 or later can be used with Couchbase Lite 2.0. Upon detecting it is a 1.x database file,
Couchbase Lite will automatically upgrade it to 2.0. This feature is only available for the default storage type (i.e
not a ForestDB database). Additionally, the automatic migration
feature does not support encrypted databases, so if the 1.x database is
encrypted you will first need to disable encryption using the Couchbase
Lite 1.x API (see the
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/couchbase-lite/native-api/database/index.html#step-2-enabling-encryption[1.x
Database Guide]).

==== Handling of Existing Conflicts

For conflicts in the 1.x database, the automatic upgrade process copies the default winning revision to the new 2.0 database and does NOT copy any conflicting revisions. This functionality is related to the way conflicts are being handled in Couchbase Lite 2.0 (see link:swift.html#handling-conflicts[Handling Conflicts]). Optionally, existing conflicts in the 1.x database can be resolved with the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/couchbase-lite/native-api/revision/index.html[1.x API] prior to the database being upgraded to 2.0.

===== Handling of Existing Attachments

Attachments that were persisted in the 1.x database will be copied to the 2.0 database. In Couchbase Lite 2.0, the `Attachment` API has been renamed to `Blob` API. The functionally is identical but the internal schema for attachments has changed. In 1.x they were stored under the `_attachments` field and in Couchbase Lite 2.0 they are stored anywhere in the document like other value types. The automatic upgrade functionality will not update the internal schema for attachments, so they will still be accessible under the `_attachments` field. The following example shows how to retrieve an attachment that was created in a 1.x database with the 2.0 API.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=1x-attachment]
----

=== Replication Compatibility

The replication protocol used in Couchbase Lite 2.0 has been re-designed from the ground up and it is not backwards compatible with the 1.x replication protocol. Therefore, to use replication with Couchbase Lite 2.0, the target Sync Gateway instance must also be upgraded to 2.0.

Sync Gateway 2.0 will continue to accept clients that connect through the 1.x protocol. It will automatically use the 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects through "http://localhost:4984/db" and the 2.0 replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 2.0 client connects through "ws://localhost:4984/db". This allows for a smoother transition to get all your user base onto a version of your application built with Couchbase Lite 2.0.

== Database

=== New Database

As the top-level entity in the API, new databases can be created using
the `Database` class by passing in a name, configuration, or both. The
following example creates a database using the `Database(string name)`
method.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=new-database]
----

Just as before, the database will be created in a default location.
Alternatively, the `Database(string name, DatabaseConfiguration config)`
initializer can be used to provide specific options in the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/T_Couchbase_Lite_DatabaseConfiguration.htm[`DatabaseConfiguration`]
object such as the database directory.

=== Database Encryption

Couchbase Lite 2.1 introduces database encryption, this functionality is exclusively available in the Enterprise Edition.

The code below demonstrates how to open or create an existing database with an encryption key. This code will not compile if you are running the Community Edition of Couchbase Lite.

[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.swift[tags=database-encryption]
----

The xref:swift.adoc#database-upgrade[automatic database upgrade] functionality is not supported for encrypted databases. Furthermore, databases encrypted with one SDK (i.e Swift, C#, Java or Objective-C) cannot be opened with another SDK.

=== Finding a Database File

Where a database goes by default depends on the platform it is running
on. Here are the defaults for each platform:

* .NET Core: `Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "CouchbaseLite")`
(unless the app context is altered [e.g. by XUnit], this will be the
same directory as the output binary)
* UWP: `Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder.Path`
(Inside the installed app sandbox. Note that this sandbox gets deleted
sometimes when debugging from inside Visual Studio when the app is
shutdown)
* Xamarin iOS: In a folder named CouchbaseLite inside of
`ApplicationSupportDirectory` (this can be retrieved more easily from
the simulator using the https://simpholders.com/3/[SimPholders] utility)
* Xamarin Android: Using the `Context` passed in the `Activate()`
method, `Context.FilesDir.AbsolutePath` (database can be retrieved using
adb)

=== Logging

The log messages are split into different domains (`LogDomains`) which
can be tuned to different log levels. The following example enables
`Verbose` logging for the `Replicator` and `Query` domains.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=logging]
----

=== Loading a pre-built database

If your app needs to sync a lot of data initially, but that data is
fairly static and won't change much, it can be a lot more efficient to
bundle a database in your application and install it on the first
launch. Even if some of the content changes on the server after you
create the app, the app's first pull replication will bring the database
up to date.

To use a prebuilt database, you need to set up the database, build the
database into your app bundle as a resource, and install the database
during the initial launch. After your app launches, it needs to check
whether the database exists. If the database does not exist, the app
should copy it from the app bundle using the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/M_Couchbase_Lite_Database_Copy.htm[`Database.Copy(string, DatabaseConfiguration)`]
method as shown below.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=prebuilt-database]
----

== Document

In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object — a
collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of
data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects. Every
document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically
generated (as a UUID) or determined by the application; the only
constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't
be changed.

=== Initializers

The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The `MutableDocument()` constructor can be used to create a new
document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
* The `MutableDocument(string documentID)` constructor can be used to
create a new document with a specific ID.
* The `database.GetDocument(string documentID)` method can be used to
get a document. If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return
`null`. This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID
already exists in the database.

The following code example creates a document and persists it to the
database.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=initializer]
----

=== Mutability

By default, when a document is read from the database it is immutable.
The `document.toMutable()` method should be used to create an instance
of the document which can be updated.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=update-document]
----

Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the
`saveDocument` method is called.

=== Typed Accessors

The `Document` class now offers a set of
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/T_Couchbase_Lite_DictionaryObject.htm[`property accessors`]
for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point
and strings. These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON
encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

In addition, as a convenience we offer `DateTimeOffset` accessors. Dates
are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the
convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format. The following
example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back
using the `document.GetDate(string key)` accessor method.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=date-getter]
----

If the property doesn't exist in the document it will return the default
value for that getter method (0 for `getInt`, 0.0 for `getFloat` etc.).
To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use
the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/M_Couchbase_Lite_Document_Contains.htm[`Document.Contains(string key)`]
method.

=== Batch operations

If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to
group them together. The following example persists a few documents in
batch.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=batch]
----

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other
`Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make
changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not
see partial changes. But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and
due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway
or other devices will receive your changes all at once.

== Blobs

We've renamed "attachments" to "blobs", for clarity. The new behavior
should be clearer too: a `Blob` is now a normal object that can appear
in a document as a property value. In other words, you just instantiate
a `Blob` and set it as the value of a property, and then later you can
get the property value, which will be a `Blob` object. The following
code example adds a blob to the document under the `avatar` property.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=blob]
----

The `Blob` API lets you access the contents as in-memory data (a `Data`
object) or as a `InputStream`. It also supports an optional `type`
property that by convention stores the MIME type of the contents.

In the example above, "image/jpeg" is the MIME type and "avatar" is the
key which references that `Blob`. That key can be used to retrieve the
`Blob` object at a later time.

When a document is synchronized, the Couchbase Lite replicator will add
an `_attachments` dictionary to the document's properties if it contains
a blob. A random access name will be generated for each `Blob` which is
different to the "avatar" key that was used in the example above. On the
image below, the document now contains the `_attachments` dictionary
when viewed in the Couchbase Server Admin Console.

image:attach_replicated.png[image]

A blob also has properties such as `"digest"` (a SHA-1 digest of the
data), `"length"` (the length in bytes), and optionally `"content_type"`
(the MIME type.) The data is not stored in the document, but in a
separate content-addressable store, indexed by the digest.

This `Blob` can be retrieved on the Sync Gateway REST API at
http://localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1[localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1].
Notice that the blob identifier in the URL path is "blob_1" (not
"avatar").

== Query

Database queries have changed significantly. Instead of the map/reduce
views used in 1.x, they're now based on expressions, of the form
"return ____ from documents where ____, ordered by ____", with semantics
based on Couchbase's N1QL query language.

There are several parts to specifying a query:

* SELECT: specifies the projection, which is the part of the document
that is to be returned.
* FROM: specifies the database to query the documents from.
* JOIN: specifies the matching criteria in which to join multiple
documents.
* WHERE: specifies the query criteria that the result must satisfy.
* GROUP BY: specifies the query criteria to group rows by.
* ORDER BY: specifies the query criteria to sort the rows in the result.

Indexing
^^^^^^^^

Before we begin querying documents, let's briefly mention the importance
of having a query index. A query can only be fast if there's a
pre-existing database index it can search to narrow down the set of
documents to examine.

The following example creates a new index for the `type` and `name`
properties.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-index]
----

If there are multiple expressions, the first one will be the primary
key, the second the secondary key, etc.

*Note:* Every index has to be updated whenever a document is updated, so
too many indexes can hurt performance. Thus, good performance depends on
designing and creating the _right_ indexes to go along with your
queries.

SELECT statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the SELECT statement, you can query and manipulate JSON data. With
projections, you retrieve just the fields that you need and not the
entire document.

A SelectResult represents a single return value of the query statement. You can specify a comma separated list of `SelectResult` expressions in
the select statement of your query. For instance the following select
statement queries for the document `_id` as well as the `type` and
`name` properties of all documents in the database. In the query result,
we print the `_id` and `name` properties of each row using the property
name getter method.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-select-meta]
----

The `SelectResult.all()` method can be used to query all the properties
of a document. In this case, the document in the result is embedded in a
dictionary where the key is the database name. The following snippet
shows the same query using `SelectResult.all()` and the result in JSON.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-select-all]
----

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "travel-sample": {
            "callsign": "MILE-AIR",
            "country": "United States",
            "iata": "Q5",
            "icao": "MLA",
            "id": 10,
            "name": "40-Mile Air",
            "type": "airline"
        }
    },
    {
        "travel-sample": {
            "callsign": "TXW",
            "country": "United States",
            "iata": "TQ",
            "icao": "TXW",
            "id": 10123,
            "name": "Texas Wings",
            "type": "airline"
        }
    }
]
----

=== WHERE statement

Similar to SQL, you can use the where clause to filter the documents to
be returned as part of the query. The select statement takes in an
`Expression`. You can chain any number of Expressions in order to
implement sophisticated filtering capabilities.

==== Comparison

The http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/T_Couchbase_Lite_Query_IExpression.htm[comparison operators] can be used in the WHERE statement to specify on which
property to match documents. In the example below, we use the `equalTo`
operator to query documents where the `type` property equals "hotel".

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-where]
----

==== Collection Operators

http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/T_Couchbase_Lite_Query_ArrayFunction.htm[Collection
operators] are useful to check if a given value is present in an array.
The following example uses the `Function.arrayContains` to find
documents whose `public_likes` array property contain a value equal to
"Armani Langworth".

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "name": "Apple Droid",
    "public_likes": ["Armani Langworth", "Elfrieda Gutkowski", "Maureen Ruecker"]
}
----

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-collection-operator]
----

==== Like Operator

The
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/M_Couchbase_Lite_Query_IExpression_Like.htm[`like`]
operator can be used for string matching. It is recommended to use the
`like` operator for case insensitive matches and the `regex` operator
(see below) for case sensitive matches.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of type `landmark`
where the name property exactly matches the string "Royal engineers
museum". Note that since `like` does a case insensitive match, the
following query will return "landmark" type documents with name matching
"Royal Engineers Museum", "royal engineers museum", "ROYAL ENGINEERS
MUSEUM" and so on.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-like-operator]
----

==== Wildcard Match

We can use `%` sign within a `like` expression to do a wildcard match
against zero or more characters. Using wildcards allows you to have some
fuzziness in your search string.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark"
where the name property matches any string that begins with "eng"
followed by zero or more characters, the letter "e", followed by zero or
more characters. The following query will return "landmark" type
documents with name matching "Engineers", "engine", "english egg" ,
"England Eagle" and so on. Notice that the matches may span word
boundaries.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-like-operator-wildcard-match]
----

==== Wildcard Character Match

We can use `_` sign within a like expression to do a wildcard match
against a single character.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of type "landmark"
where the `name` property matches any string that begins with "eng"
followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending in the letter "r".
The following query will return "landmark" `type` documents with the
`name` matching "Engineer", "engineer" and so on.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-like-operator-wildcard-character-match]
----

==== Regex Operator

The
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/M_Couchbase_Lite_Query_IExpression_Regex.htm[`regex`]
operator can be used for case sensitive matches. Similar to wildcard
`like` expressions, `regex` expressions based pattern matching allow you
to have some fuzziness in your search string.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark"
where the name property matches any string (on word boundaries) that
begins with "eng" followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending
in the letter "r". The following query will return "landmark" type
documents with name matching "Engine", "engine" and so on. Note that the
`\b` specifies that the match must occur on word boundaries.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-regex-operator]
----

=== JOIN statement

The JOIN clause enables you to create new input objects by combining two
or more source objects.

The following example uses a JOIN clause to find the airline details
which have routes that start from RIX. This example JOINS the document
of type "route" with documents of type "airline" using the document ID
(`_id`) on the "airline" document and `airlineid` on the "route"
document.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-join]
----

=== GROUP BY statement

You can perform further processing on the data in your result set before
the final projection is generated. The following example looks for the
number of airports at an altitude of 300 ft or higher and groups the
results by country and timezone.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "airport123",
    "type": "airport",
    "country": "United States",
    "geo": { "alt": 456 },
    "tz": "America/Anchorage"
}
----

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-groupby]
----

[source,text]
----
There are 138 airports on the Europe/Paris timezone located in France and above 300 ft
There are 29 airports on the Europe/London timezone located in United Kingdom and above 300 ft
There are 50 airports on the America/Anchorage timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
There are 279 airports on the America/Chicago timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
There are 123 airports on the America/Denver timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
----

=== ORDER BY statement

It is possible to sort the results of a query based on a given
expression result. The example below returns documents of type equal to
"hotel" sorted in ascending order by the value of the title property.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=query-orderby]
----

[source,text]
----
Aberdyfi
Achiltibuie
Altrincham
Ambleside

Full-Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a full-text search (FTS) query, you must have created a full-text
index on the expression being matched. Unlike regular queries, the index
is not optional. The following example inserts documents and creates an
FTS index on the `name` property.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=fts-index]
----

Multiple properties to index can be specified in the
`IndexBuilder.FullTextIndex(params FullTextIndexItem[] items)` method.

With the index created, an FTS query on the property that is being
indexed can be constructed and ran. The full-text search criteria is
defined as a `FullTextExpression`. The left-hand side is the full-text
index to use and the right-hand side is the pattern to match.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=fts-query]
----

In the example above, the pattern to match is a word, the full-text
search query matches all documents that contain the word 'buy' in the
value of the `doc.name` property.

Full-text search is supported in the following languages: danish, dutch,
english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian,
portuguese, romanian, russian, spanish, swedish and turkish.

The pattern to match can also be in the following forms:

* *prefix queries:* the query expression used to search for a term
prefix is the prefix itself with a '*' character appended to it. For
example:
+
....
"'lin*'"
-- Query for all documents containing a term with the prefix "lin". This will match
-- all documents that contain "linux", but also those that contain terms "linear",
--"linker", "linguistic" and so on.
....
* *overriding the property name that is being indexed:* Normally, a
token or token prefix query is matched against the document property
specified as the left-hand side of the `match` operator. This may be
overridden by specifying a property name followed by a ":" character
before a basic term query. There may be space between the ":" and the
term to query for, but not between the property name and the ":"
character. For example:
+
....
'title:linux problems'
-- Query the database for documents for which the term "linux" appears in
-- the document title, and the term "problems" appears in either the title
-- or body of the document.
....
* *phrase queries:* a phrase query is a query that retrieves all
documents that contain a nominated set of terms or term prefixes in a
specified order with no intervening tokens. Phrase queries are specified
by enclosing a space separated sequence of terms or term prefixes in
double quotes ("). For example:
+
....
"'"linux applications"'"
-- Query for all documents that contain the phrase "linux applications".
....
* *NEAR queries:* A NEAR query is a query that returns documents that
contain a two or more nominated terms or phrases within a specified
proximity of each other (by default with 10 or less intervening terms).
A NEAR query is specified by putting the keyword "NEAR" between two
phrase, token or token prefix queries. To specify a proximity other than
the default, an operator of the form "NEAR/" may be used, where is the
maximum number of intervening terms allowed. For example:
+
....
"'database NEAR/2 "replication"'"
-- Search for a document that contains the phrase "replication" and the term
-- "database" with not more than 2 terms separating the two.
....
* *AND, OR & NOT query operators:* The enhanced query syntax supports
the AND, OR and NOT binary set operators. Each of the two operands to an
operator may be a basic FTS query, or the result of another AND, OR or
NOT set operation. Operators must be entered using capital letters.
Otherwise, they are interpreted as basic term queries instead of set
operators. For example:
+
....
'couchbase AND database'
-- Return the set of documents that contain the term "couchbase", and the
-- term "database". This query will return the document with docid 3 only.
....
+
When using the enhanced query syntax, parenthesis may be used to specify
the precedence of the various operators. For example:
+
....
'("couchbase database" OR "sqlite library") AND linux'
-- Query for the set of documents that contains the term "linux", and at least
-- one of the phrases "couchbase database" and "sqlite library".
....

=== Ordering results

It's very common to sort full-text results in descending order of
relevance. This can be a very difficult heuristic to define, but
Couchbase Lite comes with a fairly simple ranking function you can use.
In the `OrderBy` array, use a string of the form `Rank(X)`, where `X` is
the property or expression being searched, to represent the ranking of
the result.

== Replication

Couchbase Mobile 2.0 uses a new replication protocol based on
WebSockets. This protocol has been designed to be fast, efficient,
easier to implement, and symmetrical between the client and server.

=== Compatibility

⚠️ The new protocol is *incompatible* with CouchDB-based databases. And
since Couchbase Lite 2 only supports the new protocol, you will need to
run a version of Sync Gateway that
link:../references/couchbase-lite/release-notes/index.html#compatibility-matrix[supports
it].

To use this protocol with Couchbase Lite 2.0, the replication URL should
specify WebSockets as the URL scheme (see the "Starting a Replication"
section below). Mobile clients using Couchbase Lite 1.x can continue to
use *http* as the URL scheme. Sync Gateway 2.0 will automatically use
the 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects
through "http://localhost:4984/db" and the 2.0 replication protocol when
a Couchbase Lite 2.0 client connects through "ws://localhost:4984/db".

Starting Sync Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Download Sync Gateway] and start it
from the command line with the configuration file created above.

Windows
`powershell & 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Couchbase\sync_gateway.exe' sync-gateway-config.json`

Unix `bash ~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway`

For platform specific installation instructions, refer to the Sync
Gateway
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/installation/sync-gateway/index.html[installation
guide].

=== Starting a Replication

Replication objects are now bidirectional, this means you can start a
`push`/`pull` replication with a single instance. The replication's
parameters can be specified through the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-net/db022/html/T_Couchbase_Lite_Sync_ReplicatorConfiguration.htm[`ReplicatorConfiguration`]
object; for example, if you wish to start a `push` only or `pull` only
replication. The following example creates a `pull` only replication
instance with Sync Gateway.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=replication]
----

As shown in the code snippet above, the URL scheme for remote database
URLs has changed in Couchbase Lite 2.0. You should now use `ws:`, or
`wss:` for SSL/TLS connections. You can access the Sync Gateway
`_all_docs` endpoint
http://localhost:4984/db/_all_docs?include_docs=true to check that the
documents are successfully replicated.

Couchbase Lite 2.0 uses WebSockets as the communication protocol to
transmit data. Some load balancers are not configured for WebSocket
connections by default (NGINX for example); so it might be necessary to
explicitly enable them in the load balancer's configuration (see
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/sync-gateway/nginx/index.html[Load
Balancers]).

By default, the WebSocket protocol uses compression to optimize over
speed and bandwidth. The level of compression is set on Sync Gateway and
can be tuned in the configuration file
(link:../guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html#2.0/replicator_compression[`replicator_compression`]).

==== Replication Ordering

To optimize for speed, the replication protocol doesn't guarantee that documents will be received in a particular order. So we don't recommend to rely on that when using the replication or database change listeners for example.

=== Troubleshooting

As always, when there is a problem with replication, logging is your
friend. The following example increases the log output for activity
related to replication with Sync Gateway.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=replication-logging]
----

=== Replication Status

The `replication.Status.Activity` property can be used to check the
status of a replication. For example, when the replication is actively
transferring data and when it has stopped.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=replication-status]
----

The following table lists the different activity levels in the API and
the meaning of each one.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|State |Meaning
|`STOPPED` |The replication is finished or hit a fatal error.

|`OFFLINE` |The replicator is offline as the remote host is unreachable.

|`CONNECTING` |The replicator is connecting to the remote host.

|`IDLE` |The replication caught up with all the changes available from
the server. The `IDLE` state is only used in continuous replications.

|`BUSY` |The replication is actively transferring data.
|=======================================================================

=== Handling Network Errors

If an error occurs, the replication status will be updated with an
`Error` which follows the standard HTTP error codes. The following
example monitors the replication for errors and logs the error code to
the console.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=replication-error-handling]
----

When a permanent error occurs (i.e `404`: not found, `401`:
unauthorized), the replicator (continuous or one-shot) will stop
permanently. If the error is temporary (i.e waiting for the network to
recover), a continuous replication will retry to connect indefinitely
and if the replication is one-shot it will retry for a limited number of
times. The following error codes are considered temporary by the
Couchbase Lite replicator and thus will trigger a connection retry.

- `408`: Request Timeout
- `429`: Too Many Requests
- `500`: Internal Server Error
- `502`: Bad Gateway
- `503`: Service Unavailable
- `504`: Gateway Timeout
- `1001`: DNS resolution error

=== Replication Checkpoints

Checkpoints are used by the replicator to keep track of documents that are sent to the target database. Without checkpoints, Couchbase Lite would send the entire database content every time it connects to the target database, even though the target database may already have the majority of the database content from previous replications.

This functionality is generally not a concern to application developers. But if you require the replication to start again from zero then you may call the checkpoint reset method before starting the replicator.

[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.swift[tags=replication-reset-checkpoint]
----

== Handling Conflicts

In Couchbase Lite 2.0, document conflicts are automatically resolved. This
functionality aims to simplify the default behavior of conflict handling
and save disk space (conflicting revisions will no longer be stored in
the database). There are 2 different `save` method signatures to specify
how to handle a possible conflict:

* `save(document: MutableDocument)`: when concurrent writes to an
individual record occur, the conflict is automatically resolved and only
one non-conflicting document update is stored in the database. The
Last-Write-Win (LWW) algorithm is used to pick the winning revision.
* `save(document: MutableDocument, concurrencyControl: ConcurrencyControl)`:
attempts to save the document with a concurrency control. The
concurrency control parameter has two possible values:
** `lastWriteWins`: The last operation wins if there is a conflict.
** `failOnConflict`: The operation will fail if there is a conflict.

Similarly to the save operation, the delete operation also has two
method signatures to specify how to handle a possible conflict:

* `delete(document: Document)`: The last write will win if there is a
conflict.
* `delete(document: Document, concurrencyControl: ConcurrencyControl)`:
attemps to delete the document with a concurrency control. The
concurrency control parameter has two possible values:
** `lastWriteWins`: The last operation wins if there is a conflict.
** `failOnConflict`: The operation will fail if there is a conflict.

== Database Replicas

Database replicas is available in the *Enterprise Edition* only
(https://www.couchbase.com/downloads). Starting in Couchbase Lite 2.0,
replication between two local databases is now supported. It allows a
Couchbase Lite replicator to store data on secondary storage. It would be especially useful in
scenarios where a user's device is damaged and the data needs to be
moved to a different device.

== Certificate Pinning

Couchbase Lite supports certificate pinning. Certificate pinning is a
technique that can be used by applications to "pin" a host to it's
certificate. The certificate is typically delivered to the client by an
out-of-band channel and bundled with the client. In this case, Couchbase
Lite uses this embedded certificate to verify the trustworthiness of the
server and no longer needs to rely on a trusted third party for that
(commonly referred to as the Certificate Authority).

The `openssl` command can be used to create a new self-signed
certificate and convert the `.pem` file to a `.cert` file (see
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/sync-gateway/configuring-ssl/index.html#creating-your-own-self-signed-certificate[creating
your own self-signed certificate]). You should then have 3 files:
`cert.pem`, `cert.cer` and `key.pem`.

The `cert.pem` and `key.pem` can be used in the Sync Gateway
configuration (see
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/sync-gateway/configuring-ssl/index.html#installing-the-certificate[installing
the certificate]).

On the Couchbase Lite side, the replication must be configured with the
`cert.cer` file.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Program.cs[tags=certificate-pinning]
----

This example loads the certificate from the application sandbox, then
converts it to the appropriate type to configure the replication object.
