# What is it?

The [Couchbase Lite Android](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android) library is split into two parts:

* [couchbase-lite-java-core](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-java-core) - this module, which has no dependencies on the Android API, and is usable in non-Android contexts.
* [couchbase-lite-android](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android) - which has dependencies on the Android API.

See the [Project Structure](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android/wiki/Project-structure) wiki page for more information.
