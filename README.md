couchbase-lite-net
==================

Native API port of Couchbase Lite for Android to C#.

Running Tests
=============

The replication unit tests currently require a running
instance of `sync_gateway`. Prior to running the
replication tests, start `sync_gateway` with the following
command:

*nix:
   /path/to/sync_gateway -pretty -verbose=true Couchbase.Lite/Couchbase.Lite.Tests/Assets/GatewayConfig.json

Windows:
   {TBD}

Porting Code
============

This project is a port of the Couchbase Lite portable Java codebase,
ported to C#.  The port was done with the assistance of Sharpen,
a tool that converts Java code to C#. An idiomatic C# public API
was defined in XML, and we used an XSLT stylesheet to generate
stubs for all C# types and members.

Once the Java source was bulk converted to C#, and the public API
stubs generated, we replaced the stubs one-by-one with the coverted
source, which we also refactored into idiomatic C#. We used temporary 
shims in some cases to simulate key Java classes/types that don't 
directly map to .NET Framework classes/types. Those shims that 
haven't yet been removed will disappear eventually.

The upstream Java project is:

    https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-java-core

The current codebase is based on commit:
