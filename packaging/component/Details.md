**Couchbase Lite ** is the world’s first and only full featured, flexible, mobile JSON database that runs locally on the device and is built from the ground up for mobile devices. We have native support for Objective-C, Java and now we are in Beta for .NET.

# Couchbase Mobile

Couchbase Lite is part of our comprehensive mobile stack, Couchbase Mobile. Couchbase Mobile includes:

* **Couchbase Lite:** our embedded NoSQL database built for all major platforms
* **Sync Gateway:** a sync tier that manages all of the synchronization (including user authentication, access control, data filtering and validation) between the mobile device and the server on the cloud. Sync Gateway makes it possible to quickly and easily code the synchronization between the mobile device and the server in the cloud with a page of code
* **Couchbase Server:** our enterprise-ready, document-oriented scalable NoSQL database

Couchbase Mobile enables mobile application developers to create highly responsive, datacentric applications that are always-available regardless of network connectivity. Get more info about Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server at our website:
