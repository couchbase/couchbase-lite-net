	/// This class is used to pass full generics type information, and
	/// avoid problems with type erasure (that basically removes most
	/// usable type references from runtime Class objects).
	/// It is based on ideas from
	/// &lt;a href="http://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/12/super-type-tokens.html"
	/// &gt;http://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/12/super-type-tokens.html</a>,
	/// Additional idea (from a suggestion made in comments of the article)
	/// is to require bogus implementation of <code>Comparable</code>
	/// (any such generic interface would do, as long as it forces a method
	/// with generic type to be implemented).
	/// to ensure that a Type argument is indeed given.
	/// <p>
	/// Usage is by sub-classing: here is one way to instantiate reference
	/// to generic type <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>:
	/// <pre>
	/// TypeReference ref = new TypeReference&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;() { };
	/// </pre>
	/// which can be passed to methods that accept TypeReference.
	/// </remarks>
